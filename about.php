				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>A heavy rower is typically capable of producing more power than a smaller rower, on an ergo this translates to better scores,
				 so in theory they can move a boat faster, this is not necessarily the case as the larger rower will submere the boat more which in turn creates
				 more drag which must be overcome by the rower. This means, the heavier the rower, the more power that is needed to equal the lighter rower on the water.
				 An ergo will not penalize a heavier rower as a boat would on the water. This may mean that on land, a heavier rower would be seen to have more potential.</p>
				 <p>The Concept2 Indoor Rower is a very useful tool for rowing coaches, because it provides a controlled, measurable way to compare their athlete's potential. However, it is important that coaches take into account the body weight of their rowers as well. This is where the Weight Adjustment Formula comes in. Indeed, many coaches have been using this formula over the years but it required a love of math and a pretty powerful calculator! Now itâ€™s easy with Pangbourne's Weight Adjustment Calculator, now it's even easy to share with your crews!</p>
				<h2>Usage</h2>
				<p><h3>Home Page</h3></p>
				<ul><li><b>Step 1</b>
				<p>Enter your rower data into the form, only the rower weight and distance or time is required.</p>
				<img src="img/step1.png"/ class="step"></li>

				<li><b>Step 2</b>
				<p>Review the results, it can be sorted by clicking on the desired column heading.</p>
				<img src="img/step2.png"/ class="step"></li>
				<li><b>Step 3</b>
				<p>Share the results with your rowers!</p>
				<img src="img/step3.png"/ class="step"></li></ul>

				<p><h3>Upload Page</h3></p>
				<ul><li><b>Step 1</b>
				<p>Enter your rower data into an excel spreadsheet, do not include titles, put the rower's name in column A, their weight (in kg) in column B 
				their distance (meters) in Column C and their time (H:mm:ss) in column D, then save it as a CSV file</p>
				<img src="img/ustep1.png"/ class="step"></li>

				<li><b>Step 2</b>
				<p>Upload the CSV file.</p>
				<img src="img/ustep2.png"/ class="step"></li>
				<li><b>Step 3</b>
				<p>Share the results with your rowers!</p>
				<img src="img/step3.png"/ class="step"></li></ul>
				 <h2>FAQs</h2>
				 <p><b>What is the weight adjustment formula?</b><br>Exactly the same as <a href="http://www.concept2.co.uk/indoor-rowers/training/calculators/weight-adjustment-calculator">Concept 2!</a>
				 <br>Here are the formulas used, in case you want to do the calculation when you are away from a computer:
				 <ul>
				 <li>Wf = [body weight in lbs / 270] raised to the power .222</li>
				<li>Corrected time = Wf x actual time (seconds)</li>
				<li>Corrected distance = actual distance / Wf</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p><b>Why should a coach use this adjustment calculator?</b><br>If you are going to use erg scores as one of the criteria for boating selection, it is very important that you compare weight adjusted scores. Otherwise, you will not necessarily be selecting the most effective rowers. This is due to the fact that the erg does not penalize heavier rowers for the effect that their extra weight may have on the boat speed. Our calculator also makes it effortless to record and distribute results to your rowers!</p>
				<p><b>Pangbourne is great and all, but it's not my club, can I get my own adjustment calculator?</b><br>Yes! Please <a href="mailto:felixwebdever@gmail.com">contact me</a> and I'll see what I can do.</p>
